# jQuery TodoGitHubby

Take a project as fun and complete as [TodoMVC](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/), cross it with GitHub's API and let a deranged developer splice the resulting genetic material to create Doctor Moureau's worst nightmare: TodoGitHubby: 50% ToDo list, 50% GitHub notifications. All in jQuery, all sleight of hands and slippery fingers!

> jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.
